# How to use the `t` function

Never write hardcoded text in the code, whenever you need to display text, use the `t` function.
For the react apps you can get the `t` function like this:

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

const { t } = useTranslation();
```

Once you have the `t` function, you can use it to display text like this:

```tsx
<div>{t("hello")}</div>
```

Or like this:

```tsx
<Button onClick={() => {
  toast.success(t("success"));
}}>
  {t("click_me")}
</Button>
```

You might see a type error that this key is not found in the translations, but that's okay, once you save the file this key will be extracted and added to the translations file - AUTOMATICALLY.

You don't need to worry about writing the translation content, just pick an appropriate key for the text you want to display.
